# Image + FLAC to MP4

This is a bash script that fetches all .flac files inside the "in" folder, and by using a file "cover.jpg" within that "in" folder, creates mp4 videos with the same name as the .flac file into the "out" folder.

## Requirements

[ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)

```bash
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

Make script executable

```bash
chmod +x ./convert.sh
```

You are set!
